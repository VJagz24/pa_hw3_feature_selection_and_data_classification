## Objective
The primary objective of this task is to apply data mining techniques to the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Public-Use Data** to predict the survivability rate of breast cancer patients. This involves developing a predictive model that can accurately classify patients into survivability outcomes based on a set of features derived from the SEER database.
